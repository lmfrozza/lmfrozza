**`Computer Science Student (HyperAutomation, WebDevolpment and .NET enjoyer)`**

Hello! I'm a Computer Science student and currently work at Marcopolo S/A, specializing in hyperautomation using Microsoft Power Platform (PowerApps, Power Automate, and SharePoint). With hands-on experience in building RPAs (Robotic Process Automation) and DPAs (Digital Process Automation), I enjoy finding ways to streamline and automate complex workflows.

I'm also passionate about cybersecurity, web development, and server architecture, and Iâ€™m always exploring ways to enhance system reliability and security. Here, youâ€™ll find a mix of projects that showcase my interests and skills across automation, security, and development.
