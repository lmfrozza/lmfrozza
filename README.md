**`Computer Science Student (HyperAutomation, WebDevolpment and .NET enjoyer)`**

Hello! I'm a Computer Science student and currently work at Marcopolo S/A, specializing in hyperautomation using Microsoft Power Platform (PowerApps, Power Automate, and SharePoint). With hands-on experience in building RPAs (Robotic Process Automation) and DPAs (Digital Process Automation), I enjoy finding ways to streamline and automate complex workflows.

I'm also passionate about cybersecurity, web development, and server architecture, and I’m always exploring ways to enhance system reliability and security. Here, you’ll find a mix of projects that showcase my interests and skills across automation, security, and development.
